## Project exam 1
### Description:
I created a customizable blog site with essential pages like Home, About, Blog Posts, Blog-Specific Pages, and Contact. I integrated WordPress as a Headless CMS, combining its API with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for dynamic content. Features include a 'Latest Posts' carousel, load-more functionality for blogs, dynamic content generation based on user selection, and form validation for the contact page. This project demonstrates my practical web development skills and focus on user-centric design.
